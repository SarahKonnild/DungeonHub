# Data Folder

This folder will contain all the JSON files for the official source material. 

However, that source material is proprietary and I won't just put that up here, I respect the Wizards of the Coast.

Instead, I will put a guide for the data models in here (as I make them), so you can setup the data yourself - if you wish.

As long as the names of the .json files match what I provide, are present in this folder and follow the data model, you can 
fill your own data :)
